# Changelog

All notable changes to Shruggie Markdown will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Native window close flow now uses explicit close handling (`preventDefault` + timeout-guarded save + `destroy`) to guarantee the Windows title-bar "X" exits reliably even when persistence operations stall.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Native close button (title bar "X") not closing the application on Windows when asynchronous `onCloseRequested` persistence operations stalled during shutdown.

### Changed

- Window geometry persistence now runs incrementally on move and resize with debounce, reducing reliance on close-time state writes.
- Updated gitignore handling for build/runtime artifacts: `Cargo.lock` is now tracked for the Tauri application while local verification artifacts are ignored.

### Added

- `useWindowState` regression tests covering close-handler timeout behavior and debounced move/resize persistence.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Workspace creation in the Open dialog failing due to malformed internal workspace path construction when app data directory lacked a trailing separator.
- `SplitButton` (Save / Save As) not rendering text labels when `appearance.showButtonLabels` was enabled.
- Toolbar tooltip rendering reliability by moving tooltip overlays to a body-level portal to avoid clipping/stacking issues.
- Settings panel scrollbar positioning by moving overflow scrolling to a full-width outer container so the scrollbar anchors to the right window edge.
- Workspace file discovery pipeline reliability by hardening extension normalization and using `stat()` directory metadata in the Tauri adapter.
- Recursive workspace traversal reliability by using stat-derived `isDirectory` values instead of relying solely on `readDir` metadata.

### Changed

- Toolbar redesigned into three zones: Navigation (content mode segmented control + chevron), Context (centered filename/workspace controls), and Actions (file operations + destinations).
- Content modes (View, Edit, Edit Only) are now visually grouped in a segmented control, while Workspaces and Settings are separate destination buttons.
- Toolbar brand label removed; attribution moved to Settings > About.
- Preview styling adjusted toward GitHub-flavored conventions for code blocks, tables, and blockquotes.

### Added

- Bottom status bar showing active markdown engine (left) and app version (right).
- Settings > About section with app name, runtime version, and developer attribution.
- Workspaces view management bar with workspace selector and New Workspace modal (Internal/External).
- Build-time `__APP_VERSION__` constant (with runtime-safe fallback for tests/dev).
- New/updated test coverage for SplitButton labels, StatusBar rendering, and Workspaces modal behavior.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- `scripts/clean-dist.js`: lightweight cross-platform helper that deletes only `dist/` before a Tauri build. Used by the `tauri:dev` and `tauri:build` npm scripts to prevent stale frontend output from being packaged into desktop binaries.
- Playwright MCP server configuration for VS Code Copilot (`.vscode/mcp.json`), enabling agents to visually verify UI changes via browser screenshots.
- Visual verification standing rule in `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### Changed

- `tauri:build` and `tauri:dev` npm scripts now delete `dist/` via `scripts/clean-dist.js` before invoking the Tauri CLI. This ensures no pre-existing `dist/` can be silently embedded in desktop binaries, regardless of how the build is invoked.
- RELEASING.md now includes a mandatory **Step 4 — Verify Clean Build** before the Commit and Tag step. Existing steps 4–7 renumbered to 5–8.

### Removed

- Orphaned `UrlInput` component (`src/components/Toolbar/UrlInput.tsx`) — superseded by the unified Open dialog in v0.3.0.
- Orphaned `useRemoteFetch` hook (`src/hooks/useRemoteFetch.ts`) — URL fetching now handled inside `OpenDialog` and CLI arg routing.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- **README Prerequisites overhaul**: expanded Development > Prerequisites from a brief bullet list to comprehensive per-platform dependency tables covering Windows (WiX v3, NSIS, MSVC Build Tools, WebView2), macOS (Xcode CLT), and Linux (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, GTK, etc.) requirements for desktop builds.
- **README Contributors section**: added new Contributors section with step-by-step dev environment setup guides for Windows (PowerShell) and Linux/macOS (Bash), linking to the Prerequisites tables and RELEASING.md.

### Fixed

- **Cargo.lock regenerated**: lock file updated to include resolved dependency tree for `tauri-plugin-sql` SQLite feature and transitive dependencies added in v0.3.0.

### Added

- **Edit Only mode** (`Ctrl+4`): full-screen editor without preview pane, for focused writing.
- **EditorToolbarPanel** component: collapsible quick-settings panel below the toolbar with context-sensitive controls per view mode.
- **Button labels toggle** (`appearance.showButtonLabels`): toolbar buttons can now display text labels alongside icons. Controlled via a new toggle in Settings > Appearance.
- **Scrollbar theming**: all scrollable containers use thin, theme-aware scrollbars (6 px track matching design tokens) on both WebKit and Firefox.
- `general.editorToolbarExpanded` config setting to persist pop-down panel state.
- **Storage abstraction layer** (`StorageAdapter` interface) with platform-specific backends: SQLite on desktop (via `tauri-plugin-sql`), IndexedDB on Chrome Extension and PWA. Provides unified CRUD access for config, documents, workspaces, edit history, and logs.
- **Config migration**: on first launch after upgrading from a JSON-config release, legacy `config.json` (desktop) or old IndexedDB/localStorage stores are automatically migrated to the new storage backend. The old file is renamed to `config.json.bak`.
- **Structured logging system**: module-level singleton logger that persists entries to the `logs` table/store when at or above the configured verbosity threshold. Entries include timestamp, level, module, message, and optional details.
- **Window state persistence** (desktop only): main window size, position, and maximised state are saved on close and restored on next launch. Off-screen positions are detected via `availableMonitors()` and fall back to centering.
- **Advanced settings section** in the Settings panel with a log verbosity dropdown (`debug` / `info` / `warning` / `error`).
- `advanced.logVerbosity` config key (default `"warning"`) controlling minimum severity for persisted log entries.
- **Workspace system**: replaces the former Library mode with a multi-workspace architecture supporting internal (app-managed) and external (user-chosen directory) workspaces.
- **Default workspace**: auto-created on first launch when no workspaces exist, with `is_default` flag and deletion protection.
- **Workspace CRUD**: create, delete, and manage workspaces from the Workspaces view. Internal workspace directories are created/removed automatically; external workspaces reference existing directories.
- **Per-workspace settings**: each workspace stores its own settings (recursive traversal, show hidden files, independent extension rules, extension whitelist) as JSON in the `settings` column.
- **PlatformAdapter extensions**: `getAppDataDir()`, `createDirectory(path)`, `removeDirectory(path)` methods added across all platform adapters (functional on Tauri, no-op stubs on web/PWA/Chrome).
- `fs:allow-remove` permission added to Tauri capabilities for workspace directory cleanup.
- **Unified Open dialog** (`Ctrl/Cmd+O`): tabbed dialog with File and URL source tabs, workspace selector with inline workspace creation, optional document name override. Replaces the separate file-open button and URL input toggle.
- **Export dialog** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E`): format selection dialog offering HTML, PDF, and Markdown export. Replaces separate toolbar buttons for HTML and PDF export.
- **New Document** toolbar button: creates a blank editor buffer, clears file path and document association, switches to edit mode.
- **Document model integration**: opened files (local, remote, CLI) are registered in the `documents` table with source type, path/URL, and workspace ID. Save operations create edit history snapshots and update `updated_at` timestamps.
- **Markdown export**: raw editor content can be exported/saved via the Export dialog's Markdown option.
- **`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E` keyboard shortcut**: opens the Export dialog. Direct shortcuts `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+H` (HTML) and `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` (PDF) still bypass the dialog.

### Changed

- **Three-mode view system**: view modes renamed and expanded — `full-view` → `view`, `split-view` → `edit`, plus new `edit-only` mode. Legacy config values are silently migrated on load.
- **Toolbar segmented control**: mode switcher now shows five buttons — View (`Ctrl+1`), Edit (`Ctrl+2`), Edit Only (`Ctrl+4`), Workspaces (`Ctrl+3`), Settings (`Ctrl+,`) — with the active mode highlighted.
- **Pop-down quick-settings panel**: a chevron toggle below the toolbar reveals context-sensitive controls (font size, tab size, word wrap, line numbers for editor; engine, theme for preview) that adapt to the current view mode.
- **Editor settings reactivity**: `showLineNumbers` and `wordWrap` editor preferences now reconfigure the CodeMirror instance in place via `Compartment`-based dispatch instead of requiring a full editor rebuild.
- **Focus state management**: button focus rings now use CSS `:focus-visible` exclusively, removing JavaScript `onFocus`/`onBlur` handlers from `Button` and `SplitButton`.
- Spec updated: §4.6 (toolbar mode switcher, pop-down panel, scrollbar styling, button labels, focus-visible), §5.1–§5.3.1 (three-mode view system), §7.1 (Compartment-based reactivity), §10.1.1 (editorToolbarExpanded, lastViewMode migration), §10.2 (showButtonLabels setting).
- **Config persistence rewritten**: `useConfigState` now reads/writes configuration through the `StorageAdapter` when available, falling back to legacy platform adapter JSON I/O for backwards compatibility. Config values are flattened to dotted-path key-value pairs for storage.
- Spec updated: §10.1 (storage architecture rewrite — SQLite/IndexedDB, StorageAdapter, migration), §10.1.1 (logVerbosity setting), §10.5 (storage locations with database filenames), new §10.6 (Logging), new §10.7 (Window State Persistence), §13 (tags stub tables noted).
- **Library → Workspaces terminology migration**: all UI labels, component names, data-testids, config keys, types, and hook names renamed from `Library`/`library` to `Workspaces`/`workspaces`.
- **Config key migration**: `library.recursive` → `workspace.recursive`, `library.showHidden` → `workspace.showHidden`, `library.useIndependentExtensions` → `workspace.useIndependentExtensions`, `library.independentExtensions` → `workspace.independentExtensions`. `library.mountPath` dropped (replaced by per-workspace paths).
- **Settings panel**: removed Library section; Settings now has 6 sections (Appearance, Editor, Preview, Markdown Engine, File Extensions, Advanced).
- **ViewMode type**: `"library"` → `"workspaces"` across all source and test files.
- Spec updated: §1.3 (terminology), §5.4 (Workspaces View), §5.5 (Settings sections), §9 (complete rewrite from Library Mode to Workspaces with §9.1–§9.7), §10.5 (workspaces subdirectory), §12 (project structure), plus all scattered Library references throughout.
- **I/O overhaul**: toolbar action buttons replaced — Open, New, Save/SaveAs, Export instead of Save/SaveAs + HTML + PDF + URL input. `UrlInput` component no longer used from toolbar.
- **CLI URL fetching**: rewritten to use direct `fetch()` instead of the `useRemoteFetch` hook, with document model registration in the default workspace.
- Spec updated: §6.1 "Viewing" → "Opening Files" (Open dialog, document model, CLI routing, live reload), §6.2 "Editing" (New Document, edit history), §6.3 "Converting" → "Exporting" (Export dialog, format table, direct shortcuts), §6.4 "Remote URL Fetching" → "Remote Content" (document model integration). TOC updated accordingly. "converter" → "exporter" in spec preamble.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Save As** support with native file dialog on desktop (Tauri) and browser download fallback on web/PWA/extension targets. New keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S`.
- **SplitButton** component for context-aware Save / Save As toolbar action. Shows split button with dropdown when a file path is established; shows a single Save As icon when no path exists.
- **Platform-aware default view mode**: desktop (Tauri) defaults to split-view; web, PWA, and Chrome extension default to full-view. User preference is persisted in `general.lastViewMode` config and restored on launch.
- `saveFileDialog` method on the `PlatformAdapter` interface with implementations across all four adapters.
- Inline descriptions (hint text) for every setting field in the Settings panel.
- Tooltips on all interactive elements in Settings (color mode buttons, Choose directory button, Reset to defaults, extension chip remove buttons) and UrlInput (info button).

### Changed

- Toolbar Save button replaced with `SplitButton` for unified Save / Save As behavior.
- HTML export now opens a native save dialog on desktop before falling back to browser download.
- Spec updated: §4.6 (universal tooltip requirement, SplitButton), §5.1/§5.2 (platform-aware defaults), §5.5 (field descriptions), §6.2 (Save/Save As semantics), §6.3 (export save dialog), §10.1.1 (general.lastViewMode).

### Fixed

- Workspaces table not populating on desktop: added missing `fs:allow-stat` permission to Tauri capabilities.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- Application launch failure on Windows: replaced invalid Tauri v1-style `plugins.fs.scope` config with Tauri 2-compatible `requireLiteralLeadingDot` field, resolving a deserialization panic during plugin initialization.
- Windows install path: corrected Tauri identifier to `com.shruggie-tech.shruggie-md` so NSIS installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\shruggie-tech\shruggie-md\`.
- Added `bundle.windows` config with NSIS installer settings and WebView2 download bootstrapper.
- Removed unused `features = ["unstable"]` from tauri crate dependency.
- Removed unused `use tauri::Manager` import in `lib.rs`.
- Corrected `Cargo.toml` authors from placeholder to `William Thompson`.
- Updated spec §10.5 Windows storage path to match install directory convention.
